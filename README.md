# Markov_Simulation_Supermarket

Designed as weekly project during the SPICED Data Science Bootcamp we developed a markov-chain simulation of supermarket customer behaviour. It is our (slightly politically incorrect) version of a supermarket in which an erratically moving POTUS hunts serious politicians who want to do their weekend groceries. 

While it is still under development credits already go to: CarinaFuerst, brauliotegui and rafaguev
