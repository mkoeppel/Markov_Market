# Markov_Simulation_Supermarket

Using fictional customer data of a supermarket we answer several business questions regarding customer behaviour and to model their way through the supermarket.
The project can be divided in the ffollowing steps:

Exploratory data analysis \
Calculation of transition probablilities \
Markov-Chain simulation \
Visualization

The code to answer these questions is provided in the jupyter notebook 'EDA_TransitionProbabil.ipynb'.

1. How many customers are present in each section of the supermarket throughout the week?
2. What is the total number of customers in each section over time?
3. What is the average time each customer spent in the market?
4. Are there any differences in time spent at the first section a customer visit compared to the following ones?
5. What are the revenues per section, which is the most profitable one?
6. Calculate transition probability matrix.

Additionally, to optimize customer experience while shopping, we provide a simulation of customers in this supermarket using OOP.
However, our supermarket underwent certain changes while programming (so it would be more entertaining), therefore the original sections changed:

1. dairy --> celebrities
2. spices --> snacks
3. fruits --> famous US-items
4. drinks --> alcoholics

Also, we changed our customers, so famous politicians do their shopping with us now (and somehow we caught an erratically moving POTUS haunting them).
